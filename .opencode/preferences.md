# OpenCode Preferences

## Code Style

- **NO COMMENTS**: Do not add comments to code unless explicitly requested by the user
- Write clean, self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Let the code speak for itself

## Communication

- Explain code in chat messages, not in code comments
- Show what changed, but keep the code clean
